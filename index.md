'beauty is truth, truth beauty,'-that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.

## Research Interests

- Biomedical Image Understanding

We design machine learning algorithms for the annotation, clustering and segmentation of biomedical images, including spatial gene expression images, cryo-EM single-particle images, tissue/cell images, etc.  


- Biological Language Modeling

We regard biological sequences (DNA/RNA sequences and amino acid sequences) as a special kind of language, and explore biomolecular structure and functions based on sequence analysis using statistical language models, k-mer embeddings and deep learning models.   


- Machine Learning and Data Mining

We develop algorithms to deal with large scale, imbalanced and multi-label classification problems, mainly from the biomedical field.
