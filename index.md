# About Me

<img src="/images/mmexport1523106791576.jpg" class="floatpic" width="1080" height="1440">
There is one line of John Keats's poems that I love most:<b> 'beauty is truth, truth beauty,'-that is all ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</b> To me, beauty lies in the infinity and mystery of biological science, which lets you know what you are capable of and what you are not.
