### Research Experience

## <b>Research topic 1 | Highly efficient TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst coating modified nonwoven fabrics for degrading indoor volatile organic compounds &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2016.5-2017.6</b><br>Research Assistant,Advisor: <b>Xufang Qian</b> (Associate Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering School, <b>Shanghai Jiao Tong   University</b>)

# &nbsp;&nbsp;Improved the ultraviolet light and visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles by doping- [Mo<sub>3</sub>S<sub>13</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> and carbon quantum dots, respectively.

- Web Server  , March 2018 - July 2018

Built a web server for the computational prediction and functional analysis of arsenic binding proteins in human cells. People can access to the server to find the motif. Corresponding work is currently summarized.

- Web Development & Data Collection & Model Construction  , March 2017 - March 2018

Participated in the Shanghai Jiao Tong 15th College studentsâ€™ innovative practice plan with project "Drug combination database and predictive model construction based on drug and target information" in 2017. I was in charge of the front end development of the database, collection of the data, and co-designed the predictive model. We successfully built the database and implemented the predictive model which showed a good predictive ability. The project received an A in the final presentation and I received an A+ in the presentation.
