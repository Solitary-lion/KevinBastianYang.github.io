### Research Experience

- Algorithm Development  , July 2018 - Current

Currently participating a project called Isoform Quantification via Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing in Scalable Analytics Institute, UCLA under Prof. Wei Wang’s supervision. I’m in charge of the algorithm development section of genome alignment results transformation. 

- Web Server  , March 2018 - July 2018

Built a web server for the computational prediction and functional analysis of arsenic binding proteins in human cells. People can access to the server to find the motif. Corresponding work is currently summarized.

- Web Development & Data Collection & Model Construction  , March 2017 - March 2018

Participated in the Shanghai Jiao Tong 15th College students’ innovative practice plan with project "Drug combination database and predictive model construction based on drug and target information" in 2017. I was in charge of the front end development of the database, collection of the data, and co-designed the predictive model. We successfully built the database and implemented the predictive model which showed a good predictive ability. The project received an A in the final presentation and I received an A+ in the presentation.
