# About Me

<img src="/images/mmexport1523106791576.jpg" class="floatpic" width="1080" height="1440">
My name is Yu Han. I am a senior student from the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University. I have a strong interest about nanocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis around long-term and sustainable energy and environment themes. I want to figure out and understand the specific reaction process on the surface of the catalysts in the atomic scale.

In my belief, doing research is about being creative to design an experiment or coming up a strategy to solve facing problems. That is the most fascinating thing for me.

## Research Interests

I have a broad interest in bioinformatical and biostatistical area, the following is what I'm fousing on currently.

-Computational Genomics: algorithm development, model construction, etc.

-Bioinformatics related tools developmet: database, web server, etc.
