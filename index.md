# About Me

<img src="/images/yangyang.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="250">
My name is Yang Yang.  I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I am interested in developing machine learning-based algorithms and software for biological data analysis and biomedical information processing. 

##Research Interests
- Computational molecular biology

We study computational problems regarding both protein-coding and non-coding genes. For coding genes, we predict subcellular localizations, type III secreted proteins and structual properties through sequence analysis and knowledge extraction from public databases.  
For non-coding genes, we focus on the identification of certain types of non-coding RNAs, and differential expression analysis for microRNAs with microarray or deep sequencing data.  


- Biomedical information processing

We design algorithms to screen tumor biomarkers efficiently and reliably. Now we are particularly interested in identifying microRNA biomarkers, and microRNA-disease associations.   


- Machine learning and data mining

We develop algorithms to deal with large scale, imbalanced and multi-label problems, mainly from the biomedical field.
