### Research Experience

- <b>Research topic 1 | Highly efficient TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst coating modified nonwoven fabrics for degrading indoor volatile organic compounds &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2016.5-2017.6</b><br>Research Assistant,Advisor: <b>Xufang Qian</b> (Associate Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering School, <b>Shanghai Jiao Tong   University</b>)

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Improved the ultraviolet light and visible light photocatalytic activity of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles by doping- [Mo<sub>3</sub>S<sub>13</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> and carbon quantum dots, respectively.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Immobilized modified TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on the flexible nonwoven fabrics , which improved the accessible surface area of photocatalysts significantly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Measured the  photocatalytic efficiency of [Mo<sub>3</sub>S<sub>13</sub>]<sup>2-</sup> nanoclusters modified TiO<sub>2</sub> immobilizing on non-woven fabrics photocatalysts,, which is 3 times that of undoped TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in previous literature.<hr>

- <b>Research topic 2 | High-Energy Li-Ion Batteries with Fast-Charging Capability	2017.12-2018.7</b><br>Research Assistant, Advisor: <b>Yunhang Hu</b> (Chair Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering School, <b>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</b>)

&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Independently prepared LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> coated with amorphous lithium fast ion conductor Li<sub>2</sub>O-2B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and layered MoS<sub>2</sub>, which improved the lithium ion transportation and electrons transportation, respectively.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Used the 3D graphene as the anode, which could absorb more electrolyte, to further improve the lithium ion transportation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Evaluated the novel lithium-ion battery, which shows incredible faster charging capability.

- Web Development & Data Collection & Model Construction  , March 2017 - March 2018

Participated in the Shanghai Jiao Tong 15th College studentsâ€™ innovative practice plan with project "Drug combination database and predictive model construction based on drug and target information" in 2017. I was in charge of the front end development of the database, collection of the data, and co-designed the predictive model. We successfully built the database and implemented the predictive model which showed a good predictive ability. The project received an A in the final presentation and I received an A+ in the presentation.
